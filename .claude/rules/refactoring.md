# Periodic Refactor Suggestions

Proactively suggest refactoring opportunities in the following situations:

## When to Suggest

1. **Every 6-7 versions released**: After approximately 6-7 version bumps (major, minor, or patch all count), suggest a refactoring pass. Track the version count from the changelog to determine when it's time.

2. **During long sessions**: When a session involves multiple features, fixes, or changes across several files, suggest refactors before wrapping up.

3. **When noticing code smells**: If you spot any of the following while working, flag them:
   - Duplicated code or logic across handlers
   - Handlers growing too large (should delegate to helpers)
   - Inconsistent naming or patterns
   - Dead code or unused imports
   - Overly complex conditionals or deeply nested logic
   - Formatting logic mixed into handler code

## How to Suggest

- Present refactor suggestions as a concise list with clear rationale
- Prioritize by impact: consistency and maintainability first
- Don't auto-apply — always propose and let the user decide
- Group related suggestions together (e.g., "handler cleanup", "formatting improvements")
- After each refactor proposal, add the items to `backlog.md` under a new
  section with the current date as the title (see `backlog.md` rules for format)
